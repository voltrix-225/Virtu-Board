### Air Canvas Project
 Developed an interactive "Air Canvas" application using OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a virtual drawing canvas that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures detected via a webcam.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy

Key Features:
- Hand Detection and Tracking: Utilized MediaPipe to accurately detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
- Virtual Drawing: Implemented drawing functionality that enables users to draw on a virtual canvas by moving their fingers in the air.
- Dynamic Pen Color: Incorporated keyboard controls to change the pen color dynamically (e.g., red, green, blue, white).
- Canvas Clearing: Added functionality to clear the canvas using a keyboard shortcut.
- Real-Time Video Processing: Achieved smooth and real-time video processing for an interactive user experience.

Responsibilities:
- Designed and developed the application from scratch, integrating OpenCV for video capture and drawing operations.
- Leveraged MediaPipe's hand tracking module to detect hand landmarks and interpret finger movements as drawing commands.
- Implemented a blending mechanism to overlay the virtual drawing canvas onto the live video feed.
- Developed an intuitive user interface with keyboard controls for changing pen colors and clearing the canvas.
- Ensured efficient processing to maintain real-time performance and responsiveness.

**Achievements**:
- Successfully demonstrated accurate and responsive hand tracking for virtual drawing.
- Created a user-friendly and engaging interactive drawing tool.
- Enhanced understanding and practical experience with computer vision techniques and real-time video processing.
